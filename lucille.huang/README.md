Hi Hamilton,
Thank you so much for teaching this class this semester. I learned a lot from the course. I tried so hard to match my design and my code, so I was stuck on the 5 product lists page and also the randon pick items from database (maylike.php)for few weeks, and finally, it works well. Hope you will have a wonderful summer:)
